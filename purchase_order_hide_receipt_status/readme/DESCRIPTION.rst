This custom module is designed to enhance the user experience within the Odoo 
by preventing confusion between two similar field names. Upon installation, 
this module will remove the 'receipt_status' field from both the form and tree view 
within the purchase order section. 

This action is specifically implemented to avoid any misunderstanding with the 'reception_status' field, 
which becomes visible once the 'purchase_reception_status' module is installed.
